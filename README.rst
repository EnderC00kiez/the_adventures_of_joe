Installation
============



**Option 1: Build from source**

Step 1: Install Python if you haven't already.

Step 2: Install PyInstaller. See `PyInstaller's Installation Guide <https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`_ for more info.

Step 3: Clone the repo. (Hit the Code button in github, and use Git's CLI or download a compressed version)

Step 4: Open the terminal in the game directory (or use CD to change directory to the game directory)

Step 5: Run build.py (using python (windows) or python3 (anything else))

**On Windows**

Run the following command to build:

``python build.py``

**On anything else (or if that didn't work)**

Run the following command to build:

``python3 build.py``

**Option 2: Download a pre-built executable**

Simply use the releases tab to download a compressed folder with the game files, then run the file labeled "main", "main.app", or "main.exe" (or something else)
